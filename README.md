## Android 
Android Interview Questions and Answers:

### Base
- Why does an Android App lag?
- What is Context? How is it used? - Context In Android Application
- Tell all the Android application components
- What is the project structure of an Android Application?
- What is AndroidManifest.xml?
- What is the Application class?

### Activity and Fragment
- Why is it recommended to use only the default constructor to create a Fragment?
- What is Activity and its lifecycle?
- What is the difference between onCreate() and onStart()
- When only onDestroy is called for an activity without onPause() and onStop()?
- Why do we need to call setContentView() in onCreate() of Activity class?
- What is onSaveInstanceState() and onRestoreInstanceState() in activity?
- What is Fragment and its lifecycle?
- What are "launchMode"?
- What is the difference between a Fragment and an Activity? Explain the relationship between the two
- When should you use a Fragment rather than an Activity?
- When you have some UI components to be used across various activities
- When multiple views can be displayed side by side just like ViewPager
- What is the difference between FragmentPagerAdapter vs FragmentStatePagerAdapter?
- - FragmentPagerAdapter: Each fragment visited by the user will be stored in the memory but the view will be destroyed. When the page is revisited, then the view will be created not the instance of the fragment.
  - - FragmentStatePagerAdapter: Here, the fragment instance will be destroyed when it is not visible to the user, except the saved state of the fragment.
- What is the difference between adding/replacing fragment in backstack?
- How would you communicate between two Fragments?
- What is retained Fragment?
- What is the purpose of addToBackStack() while commiting fragment transaction?
  By calling addToBackStack(), the replace transaction is saved to the back stack so the user can reverse the transaction and bring back the previous fragment by pressing the Back button.
  
### View
- What is a Canvas? - Learn from here
- What is a SurfaceView?
- Relative Layout vs Linear Layout
- Tell about Constraint Layout optimization
- Do you know what is the view tree? How can you optimize its depth?
- Optimizing layouts in Android
- What is View in Android?
- Difference between View.GONE and View.INVISIBLE?
- Can you a create custom view? How?
- What are ViewGroups and how they are different from the Views?
  View: View objects are the basic building blocks of User Interface(UI) elements in Android. View is a simple rectangle box which responds to the userâ€™s actions. Examples are   EditText, Button, CheckBox etc. View refers to the android.view.View class, which is the base class of all UI classes.
ViewGroup: ViewGroup is the invisible container. It holds View and ViewGroup. For example, LinearLayout is the ViewGroup that contains Button(View), and other Layouts also. ViewGroup is the base class for Layouts.

### Dialogs and Toasts

### Intents and Broadcasting
- What is Intent?
- What is an Implicit Intent?
- What is an Explicit Intent?
- What is a BroadcastReceiver?
- What is a Sticky Intent?
Sticky Intents allows communication between a function and a service. sendStickyBroadcast() performs a sendBroadcast(Intent) known as sticky, i.e. the Intent you are sending stays around after the broadcast is complete, so that others can quickly retrieve that data through the return value of registerReceiver(BroadcastReceiver, IntentFilter). For example, if you take an intent for ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED to get battery change events: When you call registerReceiver() for that action â€” even with a null BroadcastReceiver â€” you get the Intent that was last Broadcast for that action. Hence, you can use this to find the state of the battery without necessarily registering for all future state changes in the battery.
- Describe how broadcasts and intents work to be able to pass messages around your app?
- What is a PendingIntent?
If you want someone to perform any Intent operation at future point of time on behalf of you, then we will use Pending Intent.
